## Saving your changes with Git in Visual Studio Code
You should "commit" (save) your changes every time you make a significant edit to a file, be it your index.html file or any other file. This way, if you accidentally mess it up or break something, you can go back to the last working version. Here's how to do that in VSCode:
1. Click the "Source Control" tab (on the left, under the magnifying glass).
2. Click on the plus button to stage all your changes.
3. Commit (save) your changes by clicking the tick near the top of the window.
4. Synchronize your changes by clikcing the "refresh" button in the bottom-left corner of the window.
