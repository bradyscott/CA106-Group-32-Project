                    <h3>Scott Brady</h3>
                    <p>I was reponsible for the Iceland section of the site. I also played a major role in the overall
                        design of the site, including the homepage and the navigation bars.</p>
                    <p>Some mistakes I made were:</p>
                    <ol class="mistakes">
                        <li>
                            Using accents in the filenames of my sound files:
                            <p>
                                This caused issues when I checked my language page on the W3C HTML validator. To fix
                                this, I had to remove the accents from the filenames.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Using an "ol" tag on the language page:
                            <p>
                                This also caused issues with the validator as I
                                had placed other elements such as paragraps and audio with in the "li" elements, which I
                                learned was not a correct thing to do. To fix it, I replaced the list with several
                                article
                                tags instead.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    <h3>Jack MacNamara</h3>
                    <p>I was reponsible for France segement of this project. </p>
                    <p>Some mistakes I made were:</p>
                    <ol class="mistakes">
                        <li>
                            Using uppercase when naming files. 
                            <p>
                                This caused a major issue when i was linking files due to serves being case sensitive. It took a while to figure out the mistake but eventually I fixed the issue. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Forgetting to close off the tags in my HTML file.
                            <p>
                                This cause a major problem when running my code in chrome. Most paragraphs we not in sequence and all over the place due to not closing off tags. 
                            </p>
                        </li>

                    <p>I was reponsible for the Nigeria section of the site.</p>
                    <p>Some mistakes I made were:</p>
                    <ol class="mistakes">
                        <li>
                            Closing tag:
                            <p>
                                I forgot to close the "table" tag, so this made my table appear down the page, below the footer. So I had to close the tag to fix the issue.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                            Wrong Directory:
                            <p>
                                I used a wrong directory for the image part of the Nigeria section. I used "image" instead of "img", so the images did not appear.
                            </p>

                    <p>I was reponsible for the New Zealand section of this project.</p>
                    <p>Some mistakes I made were:</p>
                    <ol class="mistakes">
                        <li>
                            Linking the CSS file:
                            <p>
                               One mistake I made was with linking the CSS file to my html. It worked locally but when I uploaded it to FileZilla the css wasn't linking correctly. I had to get help from my group with this problem but it ended up just being a minor problem with where I had it saved.
                            </p>

                            Images:

                                One of my images did not load the way it was meant to because it got converted from png file to a jpeg file which caused the image to appear different.

                    <p>Some mistakes I made were:</p>

                        <li>
                            Main CSS wasn't linked:
                            <p>
                                I forgot to link to the main css file with my html so my webpage didnâ€™t have any css. This meant I didn't have any nav bar or footer.

                            <p>
                                My CSS was not working for me as I had a typo in the class name so that prevented anything from working and it caused a lot of troubleshooting before I noticed this simple mistake.
