                <h3>Crepes</h3>
                <p>
                    The French Crepe is a very thin but packed full of flavour. To us a Crepe would mirror our famous
                    pancakes. Crepes are a delicacy usually enjoyed after a flavoursum meal. Many times Crepes are stuffed
                    with chocolate to add that extra little bit of flavour that many people love some much. This Crepes 
                    are usually garnished with fresh fruit and some icing sugar to decorate.

                <h3>Ratatouille</h3>
                <p>
                    Ratatouille has to be my favourite French delicacy of all time! Ratatouille is such a simple recipe
                    to make, although when ready it looks like a meal served in a five star Restaurent. Ratatouille is
                    essentially a stew. The main ingredients include tomato, garlic, onion, courgette with some other
                    ingredients being added by other chefs. Some chefs include meat as an ingredient but its not mandatory.
