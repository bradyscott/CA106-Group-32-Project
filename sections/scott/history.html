                <h3>Viking Iceland</h3>
                <h5>Source: <a href="http://www.localhistories.org/iceland.html">LocalHistories.org</a></h5>
                <p>The first people to settle in Iceland were probably Irish monks who came in the 8th century. However,
                    in
                    the 9th century, they were driven out by Vikings.</p>
                <p>According to tradition the first Viking to discover Iceland was a man named Naddoddur who got lost
                    while
                    on his way to the Faeroe Islands. Following him, a Swede named Gardar Svavarsson circumnavigated
                    Iceland
                    about 860. However, the first Viking attempt to settle was by a Norwegian named Floki Vilgeroarson.
                    He
                    landed in the northwest but a severe winter killed his domestic animals and he sailed back to
                    Norway.
                    However, he gave the land its name. He called it Iceland.</p>
                <p>Then from 874 many settlers came to Iceland from Norway and the Viking colonies in the British Isles.
                    A
                    Norwegian named Ingolfur Arnarson led them. He sailed with his family, slaves, and animals.
                </p>
                <p>When he sighted Iceland Ingolfur dedicated his wooden posts to his gods then threw them overboard. He
                    vowed to settle at the place where the sea washed them up. He then explored Iceland. When the posts
                    were
                    found in the southwest of Iceland Ingolfur and his household settled there. He called the place
                    Reykjavik, meaning Smokey Bay. Many other Vikings followed him to Iceland.
                </p>
                <p>The land in Iceland was free to whoever wanted it. A man could claim as much land as he could light
                    fires around in one day while a woman could claim as much land as she could lead a heifer round in
                    one day.</p>
                <p>There were very good fishing grounds around Iceland and the land was well suited to sheep. Many
                    Vikings brought flocks with them and soon sheep became a major Icelandic industry. The population of
                    Iceland soared. By about 930 there were about 60,000 people living in Iceland.</p>
                <p>At first the Icelanders were ruled by chiefs called Godar but there were some local assemblies. About
                    930 the Icelanders created an assembly for the whole island called the Althing.</p>

                <h3>Iceland in the Middle Ages</h3>
                <h5>Source: <a href="http://www.localhistories.org/iceland.html">LocalHistories.org</a></h5>
                <p>
                    In the 11th century the Norwegians were converted to Christianity. The Norwegian kings sent
                    missionaries to Iceland. Some Icelanders accepted the new religion but many were bitterly opposed.
                    Eventually, a man named Thorgeir, who was the law speaker of the Althing, realized there was likely
                    to be a civil war between the two. He may also have feared Norwegian intervention. (The Norwegians
                    were quite prepared to 'convert' people to Christianity by force!). He persuaded the people to
                    accept a compromise. Christianity became the 'official' religion of Iceland but pagans were allowed
                    to worship their gods in private.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the 12th century conditions on Iceland deteriorated. It may have been partly due to
                    overgrazing. The forests were also cut down and the result was soil erosion. With no wood to build
                    ships, the Icelanders were dependent on Norwegian merchants. At that time wool, animal hides, horses
                    and falcons were exported from Iceland. Timber, honey, and malt for brewing were imported. Some
                    Icelanders began to look to the king of Norway to protect trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 14th and early 15th centuries troubled years for Iceland. In the early 14th century, the climate
                    grew colder. Then in 1402-03, the Black Death struck Iceland and the population was devastated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However prosperity returned in the 15th century. At that time there was a big demand in Europe for
                    Icelandic cod and Iceland grew rich on the fishing industry. Icelanders traded with the English and
                    with the Germans.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Meanwhile in 1397 Norway was united with Denmark. Afterward, Iceland was ruled by the Danish crown.

                <h3>Iceland 1500-1800</h3>
                <h5>Source: <a href="http://www.localhistories.org/iceland.html">LocalHistories.org</a></h5>
                <p>
                    During the 16th century Iceland, like the rest of Europe, was rocked by the reformation. Denmark
                    became Protestant in the 1530s and in 1539 the Danish king ordered his men to confiscate the
                    church's land in Iceland. The bishops of Iceland resisted and in 1541 the Danish king sent an
                    expedition to enforce conformity. Skalholt was given a new bishop but the bishop of Holar, a man
                    named Jon Aranson continued to resist. He was a powerful chieftain as well as a bishop and he had
                    soldiers to fight for him. He also had two sons, by his concubine, who supported him. In 1548
                    Aranson was declared an outlaw. His soldiers then captured the Protestant bishop of Skalholt.
                    However, in 1550 he was defeated. Aranson and his two sons were executed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Afterwards the people of Iceland gradually accepted Protestantism and in 1584 the Bible was
                    translated into Icelandic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However during the 17th century the Icelanders suffered hardship. In 1602 the king made all trade
                    with Iceland a monopoly of certain merchants in Copenhagen, Malmo, and Elsinore. In 1619 the
                    monopoly was made a joint-stock company. The monopoly meant the Icelanders were forced to sell goods
                    to the company at low prices and buy supplies from them at high prices. As a result, the Icelandic
                    economy suffered severely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1783 the fallout from volcanic eruptions caused devastation in Iceland. By 1786 the population of
                    Iceland was only 38,000. Finally, in 1800 the Althing closed. A new law court replaced it. It sat in
                    Reykjavik which at that time was a little community of 300 people.

                <h5>Source: <a href="http://www.localhistories.org/iceland.html">LocalHistories.org</a></h5>
                <p>
                    In the 19th century ties between Iceland and Denmark weakened. Nationalism was a growing force
                    throughout Europe including Iceland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1854 remaining restrictions on trade were removed. Trade with Iceland was opened to all nations.
                    Furthermore Icelandic fishing became much more prosperous in the late 19th century. Until then
                    fishermen usually used rowing boats but by the end of the century they had switched to much more
                    effective decked sailing ships.

                <h3>Iceland in the 20th Century</h3>
                <h5>Source: <a href="http://www.localhistories.org/iceland.html">LocalHistories.org</a></h5>
                <p>
                    Iceland began to prosper once again. The population rose (despite emigration to Canada) and in 1911
                    Reykjavik University was founded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the 20th century ties with Denmark were loosened. In 1904 Iceland was granted home rule. The post
                    of governor was abolished. Instead Iceland gained an Icelandic minister responsible to the Althing.
                    Then in 1918 Iceland was made a sovereign state sharing a monarchy with Denmark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1915 Icelandic women were allowed to vote. The first woman was elected to the Althing in 1922.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in May 1940, Iceland was occupied by British troops. In May 1941 the Americans relieved them.
                    Finally in 1944 Iceland broke all links with Denmark and the joint monarchy was dissolved.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1947 Mount Hekla erupted causing much destruction but Iceland soon recovered and in 1949 Iceland
                    joined NATO.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the late 20th century Iceland had a series of 'cod wars' with Britain. Iceland relied on its
                    fishing industry and grew alarmed that the British were overfishing its waters. The 'cod wars' were
                    'fought' in 1959-1961, 1972 and in 1975-1976.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1980 Vigdis Finnbogadottir was elected president of Iceland. She was the first elected woman
                    president in the world.

                    The people of Iceland benefit from natural hot water, which is used to heat their homes. It is also
                    used to heat greenhouses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2008 Iceland suffered an economic crisis when its 3 main banks failed. In 2009 demonstrations led
                    to the fall of the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today Iceland still relies on fishing but there are many sheep, cattle and Icelandic ponies. Iceland
                    suffered badly in the world financial crisis that began in 2008 and unemployment rose to over 9%.
                    However, Iceland soon recovered and unemployment fell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today Iceland is a prosperous country with a high standard of living.
